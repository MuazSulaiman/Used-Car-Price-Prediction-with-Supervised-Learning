# **Used Car Price Prediction with Supervised Learning**

In this data-driven project, I've harnessed the power of supervised learning to build a robust and accurate model for predicting used car prices. Leveraging well-established techniques such as multilinear and polynomial regression, and employing rigorous data cleaning practices, this project offers a detailed and insightful approach to valuing pre-owned vehicles.

**Key Highlights:**

- **Supervised Learning:** Through the use of historical data, we've trained our models to learn the intricate relationships between various car attributes and their market prices.

- **Multilinear and Polynomial Regression:** We've explored different regression models to capture both linear and non-linear dependencies, resulting in a more nuanced and precise price prediction.

- **Data Cleaning Excellence:** Our commitment to data quality ensures that the predictions are based on accurate, reliable information.

**What to Expect:**

- Transparent insights into the factors that influence used car prices.
- An opportunity to learn how machine learning can revolutionize pricing strategies in the automotive industry.

Whether you're a car enthusiast, buyer, or seller, this project offers valuable insights into the factors that drive the prices of used cars. It's not just about predicting prices; it's about understanding what makes each car unique in the market.
